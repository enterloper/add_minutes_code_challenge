# Affinipay Code Challenge

Without using any built-in date or time functions, write a function or method that accepts two mandatory arguments: the first argument is a 12-hour time string with the format "[H]H:MM AM|PM", and the second argument is an integer. The second argument is the number of minutes to add to the time of day represented by the first argument. The return value should be a string of the same format as the first argument. For example, AddMinutes("9:13 AM", 200) would return "12:33 PM". The exercise isn't meant to be too hard or take very long; we just want to see how you code. Use any mainstream language you want, though Javascript, Java, Scala, and Ruby are particularly relevant to us. Please include any test cases that you write.
